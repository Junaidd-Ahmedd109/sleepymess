<h3 id="how-are-sleep-disorders-treated-">How are sleep disorders treated?</h3>
<p>There are a variety of treatments recommended by healthcare providers:</p>
<strong>
<ul>
    <li>Counseling: Some sleep specialists recommend cognitive behavior therapy. Such counseling helps you “recognize, challenge and change stress-inducing thoughts” that can keep you awake at night.</li>
    <li>Medications and/or supplements.</li>
    <li>Practice sleep hygiene such as keeping a regular sleep schedule.</li>
    <li>Get regular exercise.</li>
    <li>Minimize noise.</li>
    <li>Minimize light.</li>
    <li>Manage the temperature so that you’re comfortable.</li>
    </ul></strong>
    <p>Your healthcare provider will recommend treatments based on your unique situation.</p>
    <h3 >What medicines may help with sleep disorders?</h3>
    <p>Your healthcare provider may recommend some of the following medications and supplements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Sleep aids may be helpful in some cases of insomnia, including melatonin, zolpidem, zaleplon, eszopiclone, ramelteon, suvorexant, lamborexant, or doxepin.</li>
        <li>Restless legs syndrome can be treated with gabapentin, gabapentin enacarbil, or pregabalin. </li>
        <li>Narcolepsy may be treated with a number of stimulants or wake-promoting medications, such as modafinil, armodafinil, pitolisant and solriamfetol.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 >Should I see a specialist?</h3>
        <p>Ask your healthcare provider for a referral to a sleep specialist, if necessary.</p>
        <h3 >What are some tips for getting a good night's sleep?
        <p>Ask your healthcare provider for a referral to a sleep specialist, if necessary.</p></h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create an optimal sleep environment</strong> by making sure that your bedroom is comfortable, cool, quiet and dark. If noise keeps you awake, try using background sounds like "white noise" or earplugs. If light interferes with your sleep, try a sleep mask or blackout curtains.</li>
            <li><strong>Think positive.</strong> Avoid going to bed with a negative mind set, such as "If I don't get enough sleep tonight, how will I ever get through the day tomorrow?"</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid using your bed for anything other than sleep and intimate relations.</strong> Do not watch television, eat, work, or use computers in your bedroom.</li>
            <li><strong>Try to clear your mind before bed time</strong> by writing things down or making a to-do list earlier in the evening. This is helpful if you tend to worry and think too much in bed at night.</li>
            <li><strong>Establish a regular bedtime and a relaxing routine</strong> each night by taking a warm bath, listening to soothing music, or reading. Try relaxation exercises, meditation, biofeedback, or hypnosis. Wake up at the same time each morning, including days off and vacations.</li>
            <li><strong>Stop clock watching.</strong> Turn the clock around and use only the alarm for waking up. Leave your bedroom if you cannot fall asleep in 20 minutes. Read or engage in a relaxing activity in another room.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid naps.</strong> If you are extremely sleepy, take a nap. But limit naps to less than 30 minutes and no later than 3 p.m.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid stimulants</strong> (coffee, tea, soda/cola, cocoa and chocolate) and heavy meals for at least four hours before bedtime. Light carbohydrate snacks such as milk, yogurt, or crackers may help you fall asleep easier.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoid alcohol and tobacco</strong> for at least four hours before bedtime and during the night.</li>
            <li><strong>Exercise regularly,</strong> but not within four hours of bedtime if you have trouble sleeping.</li>
            </ul>

             <h3>What foods or drinks should I take or avoid to reduce my risk of a sleep disorder?</h3>
             <p>Avoid the following: </p><strong>

                <li>Decongestants. </li>

                <li>Tobacco. </li>
                <li>Alcohol.</li>
