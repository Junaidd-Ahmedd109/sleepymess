<h2 id="what-causes-sleep-disorders-">What causes sleep disorders?</h2>
<p>Sleep problems can be caused by various factors.
Although causes might differ, the end result of all sleep disorders is that the body's natural cycle of 
slumber and daytime wakefulness is disrupted or exaggerated.
Eight factors include: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical (such as ulcers). </li>
<li>Medical (such as <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/asthma-an-overview" target="_blank">asthma</a>). </li>
<li>Psychiatric (such as <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/depression" target="_blank">depression</a> and <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/articles/anxiety-disorders" target="_blank">anxiety disorders</a>). </li>
<li>Environmental (such as alcohol). </li>
<li>Working the night shift (this work schedule messes up “biological clocks.”) </li>
<li>Genetics (narcolepsy is genetic). </li>
<li>Medications (some interfere with sleep). </li>
<li>Aging (about half of all adults over the age of 65 have some sort of sleep disorder. 
It is not clear if it is a normal part of aging or a result of medicines that older people commonly use). </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-are-the-symptoms-of-sleep-disorders-">What are the symptoms of sleep disorders?</h2>
